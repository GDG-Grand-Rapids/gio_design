The Android app allows the user to explore local events, add them to their profile, and view event descriptions, session schedules, and details about each session. They can also "pin" sessions they want to attend and view just the pinned sessions. 

Each event is branded with the main hue of the event photo. That color is carried throughout the UI for the event detail and schedule. Each session is branded with the color of the "type" of session: speaker, video, code lab, etc.

This directory contains the images used for the mobile prototypes, a storyboard/screen flow, and a style guide.
